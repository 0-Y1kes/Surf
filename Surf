Surf is a new roblox script executor which bypasses Byfron and lets you execute scripts on the microsoft store version a well as the web version of roblox.

This is the first version of Surf so it may have a few glitches. Those will be patched within 48 hours.

It is requested to launch roblox in the web version of roblox for it to take full effect. There is no linkvertise link, you can download it straight from here.

Wait a couple of minutes for it to launch.

This executor is completely free so there will be some ads on the executor for us to make  revenue.
